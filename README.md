<h2><b>Description:</b></h2>

This app tracks your location as you pass various businesses on your day to day routine. If the business you pass is on the list, it will be added to your list of companies and you will be given a point for you. If you get enough points, you will receive a reward that can be redeemed at that business. While there is no limit on the amount of points you can get right now. There plans to limit it to two points per day using time stamps. This project was made within two weeks. It is configured for both andriod and ios.
